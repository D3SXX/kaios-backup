## Description

KaiOS Backup uses mozilla's APIs to backup data. Currently it has options to export SMS, MMS and Contacts. This data can be exported to the following formats - 

- Plain Text File (.txt)
- JSON (The best option if you want to keep the native structure)
- CSV (Has option to export Contacts to Google and Outlook Contacts CSV format)
- XML

The program was tested on Nokia 8110 4g with KaiOS 2.5.1.

## Conversion and Import on Android

You can import SMS and MMS data to an Android device. [For more details, see this guide](/convert/README.md). 

## Notes

- To export contacts in Google CSV and Outlook CSV formats, simply choose "CSV format" in the Export tab and then select your preferred format in the options menu.
- Google and Outlook CSV support up to 2 phone numbers, 1 address, and 2 email addresses. (Additional fields may be added in future updates.)
- To enable or disable debug output, press the "#" key once.

## For the future (To-Do)

- Test program on different systems
- Add additional data selection options
